/**
 * GPU picker serialization / no-deadlock tests (issue #328).
 *
 * A `GpuPicker` owns a single pair of 1×1 staging buffers (`pick-color-staging` /
 * `pick-depth-staging`). Two picks that map them concurrently crash WebGPU with
 * "buffer already mapped". `pickAsync` therefore serializes: each pick waits for the
 * previous one to settle before starting. The risk with any such gate is a permanent
 * lock — a pick that never resolves, or a rejected pick that poisons the chain, would
 * block every future pick forever. These tests pin down that the gate:
 *   - runs picks strictly one-at-a-time (never overlapping),
 *   - lets a failed pick be followed by a successful one (no poison / permanent lock),
 *   - never leaves the internal gate rejected.
 *
 * They drive the REAL `pickAsync` wrapper via `pickAsyncImpl`'s no-camera fast path (a scene
 * with `camera: null` returns an empty `PickingInfo` immediately), so the serialization
 * logic is exercised without a WebGPU device.
