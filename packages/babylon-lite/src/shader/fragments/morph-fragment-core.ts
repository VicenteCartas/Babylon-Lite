/**
 * Morph Target Fragment (shared core)
 *
 * Vertex-stage morph target animation: storage-buffer position/normal deltas
 * applied before skinning. Consumed by both the PBR morph extension
 * (material/pbr/fragments/morph-fragment.ts) and the Standard material
 * renderable. Only bundled when a scene uses morph targets.
 *
 * The deltas and weights live in read-only storage buffers (no uniforms, no
 * texture atlas) so the layout grows past the old vec4 (4-target) limit.
 *
 * To keep the shared `shader-composer.ts` free of any storage-buffer support
 * (so non-morph scenes pay zero bytes for it), the bindings are declared as
 * placeholder `uniform-buffer` entries and a `_postCompose` step rewrites the
 * two emitted decls (and their BGL entries) from `uniform` to read-only
 * `storage` after composition. The composer never learns about storage buffers.

 *
 *  The two morph bindings are declared as `uniform-buffer` placeholders so the shared
 *  `shader-composer.ts` needs no storage-buffer support (keeping non-morph scenes byte-identical).
 *  The rewrite is anchored on the unique binding names (`morphDeltas`, `morph`) and asserts both were
 *  found, so any future change to the composer's decl format fails loudly here rather than silently
 *  shipping a wrong address space. The pattern tolerates arbitrary whitespace (`\s*`) around the
 *  punctuation because the production WGSL minifier strips spaces adjacent to `)`/`<`/`>`/`:` — the
 *  composed decl is `)var<uniform>morphDeltas:` in the minified bundle vs `) var<uniform> morphDeltas:`
 *  in dev. A regex with hard-coded single spaces matches 0 in the bundle and breaks every morph scene
 *  (see GUIDANCE.md: never depend on emitted WGSL whitespace). */
