/** Shared per-binding GPU frustum-culling lifecycle for thin-instanced renderables.
 *
 *  Dynamically imported only when a scene enables thin-instance GPU culling, and
 *  it statically pulls in the compute-cull module — so non-culling scenes fetch
 *  neither this helper nor `thin-instance-gpu-culling.ts`.
 *
 *  Factored here so Standard, PBR, and ShaderMaterial renderables share one
 *  implementation of the cull lifecycle instead of copy-pasting it three times.
 *  `tryBind` is the single seam a renderable's `bind()` calls: it does the
 *  opaque-only gate + per-mesh `_gpuCullingEnabled` check and creates the
 *  per-binding state. The renderable then reads
 *  `cullDrawBufs` for the compacted instance source and calls `binding.draw(...)`
 *  for the indirect-vs-fallback draw call. Keeping these few seams tiny is what
 *  lets non-culling scenes — which still fetch the per-material renderable
 *  chunks — stay within their bundle-size ceilings. */

 *  stays bundle-compatible because its compacted buffers and indirect args are
 *  stable; cull-state transitions bump the bundle invalidation epoch.
 *
 *  The cull STATE (visible/args/params GPU buffers) is REUSED across re-binds: it
 *  is cached on the renderable, keyed by the pass's render-target signature.
 *  `buildBindings` re-binds every renderable on each `_renderableVersion` bump
 *  (i.e. on ANY geometry edit anywhere in the scene), so allocating a fresh state
 *  here each time both leaked the previous state's buffers (freed only on mesh
 *  dispose) AND churned Dawn's allocator by reallocating these buffers every edit
 *  — multi-MB per edit. Reusing keeps `ensureCullBuffers` a no-op when the
 *  instance capacity is unchanged. Keying by signature keeps a renderable drawn
 *  in several passes (e.g. main + shadow) on an independent cull state per pass.
 *  Each cached state is freed once, on mesh disposal. */
